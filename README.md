The most advanced MC sampling algorithm-NUTS.

Due to bugs for unknown reason, I failed to launch the NUTS sampling based on Pymc3 library, which forced me to code from scratch based on Hoffman's article.

With in-process inspection, IACF calculation and GR diagnosis.

Seems to have overflow issues.
